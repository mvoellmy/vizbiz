\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Framework}
This pipeline was developed in MATLAB. Since the group consists of four students, a Git repository was used to be able to work on different files simultaneously, and to enable version control.

\subsubsection{Coordinate Frames}
In this mini project the coordinate frames were defined as shown in \cref{img_coord_frames}. The camera coordinates are in a way oriented, that the x-y plane lies parallel to the image plane, while the z-axis is pointing towards the scenery. The world frame however is oriented in such a way that the x-y plane is parallel to the ground and the the z-axis is pointing upwards.

The origin of the world frame is at the same location as the origin of the first boot-strap image.

\subsubsection{Pipeline overview}

As shown in \cref{img_flow_rough} the pipeline consists mainly of three parts, a bootstrap, the initialisation and the continuous operation. In \cref{sec_init} and \cref{sec_cont_op} the initialisation and the continuous operation are described in detail.

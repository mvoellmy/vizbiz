\section{Introduction}
The aim of this mini project is the development of a visual odometry pipeline. This pipeline takes the consecutive gray-scale images of a single digital camera as input. Therefore the pipeline developed in this mini project is a monocular visual odometry pipeline.

The output of the pipeline is the position of the camera in relation to its initial position for each frame.
